# Modern JavaScript

Putting together a modest resource that should be available for anyone wanting to reference more modern JavaScript while working on projects.

The purpose here is to keep the information grouped based on the relevance. I'm not going into detail about the core legacy JavaScript, I'm going to be focusing mostly on the more modern aspects, hence the name of the repo, "Modern JavaScript."
